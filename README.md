planned changes:

-Trevor's stuff to finish
>reformat list to a card based system to display the four currently functioning characters
>fiddle with page formatting to make everything a little cleaner and prettier
>build featured character page (initially as a static character but build in random character selection if you've got the time)
>finish out the history save and load function

-other necessary stuff
>build character cards to display the necessary information (I was thinking we build cards with the character picture, their name, and maybe a little snippet about them?) (for now I was thinking we just build a static five cards, idk what characters y'all would wanna use for that)
>utilize the marvel API to populate character information based on what a person is looking for (movies/comics that the character is featured in). Maybe we build the functionality into buttons? Like, you click on a character and then there's a dropdown with a button for movies and then a button for comics. Idk for sure tho, and I think we should discuss it some more.
>maybe we add outgoing character
